### Getting started

## How to run:
1. Open your browser
2. Open the file index.html
3. Select an event from the drop down and see the result.

# Personal Note:
I have sent you both java as well as react project for the events solution. I am not too proficient in REACT, this is my second try, so I sent you a java solution too.
